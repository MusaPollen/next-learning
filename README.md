The error you're encountering occurs because PowerShell's execution policy is set to restrict the running of scripts, including the pnpm.ps1 script. To fix this issue, you'll need to change the execution policy to allow running of scripts.

Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

Step-by-Step Solution:
Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Press Win + X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin).
If you can't find PowerShell in the menu, you can search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-click it, and choose "Run as administrator."
Check the Current Execution Policy: Run the following command to check your current execution policy:

powershell
Copy code
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Change the Execution Policy: To allow scripts to run, use this command:

powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
RemoteSigned allows local scripts to run, and scripts downloaded from the internet must be signed by a trusted publisher.
Alternatively, if you want to allow all scripts (less secure), you can use:

powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
If you are prompted to confirm the change, type Y and press Enter.

Verify the Change: After changing the policy, you can verify it by running:

powershell
Copy code
Get-ExecutionPolicy
It should now show RemoteSigned or Unrestricted, depending on what you chose.

Retry the Command: Now you can try running the pnpm command again:

powershell
Copy code
pnpm -v
Important Notes:
Be cautious when setting the execution policy to Unrestricted, as it could allow potentially harmful scripts to run.
You can always revert to a more restrictive policy later by running Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted.
Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you run into any further problems!
